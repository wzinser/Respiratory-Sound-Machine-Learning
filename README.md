# Classifying Respiratory Sounds with Machine Learning

The purpose of this repository is to use automated machine learning algorithms to classify audio samples to aid in the detection of respiratory conditions (wheezes/crackles). This is accomplished by performing a spectrogram of each sound of the respiratory cycle to display a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies in the signal. This image is then grayscaled, downsized, and flattened to a vector so that it can be used as input into a neural network.

### Prerequisites

Python 3.3
 - TensorFlow Library
 - Numpy Library

All code for this project was written and executed in Jupyter Notebook on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Virtual Machine). Python packages were managed with Anaconda.
